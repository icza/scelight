			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">New File Operations: Copy / Move / Pack</span><br>The Replay list page now contains 3 additional icons in the tool bar: Copy, Move and Pack Selected Replays. They do what their name say.<br>In all of those 3 operations you have the option to "Preserve subfolders relative to source Replay Folder".</li>
				<li>New setting under the Replay Folder Monitor node:<br><span class="h">Only pick up "Just Played" new replays</span><br>
				If this is enabled (it is by default), only games that were just played will be picked up as new replays.<br>
				The advantage and consequence of this is that if you download replays from others or you copy / drop "old" replays into monitored replay folders, they will not be picked up and handled as "new replays".<br>
				This extends to everything under the Replay Folder Monitor node: renaming new replays, auto-opening them in the Replay Analyzer, showing Last Game Info Overlay, Auto backup, playing 'Replay saved' voice.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Added Archon mode support.</span><br>Archon mode replays are now supported (attempt to open them in the previous version caused an out of memory error and instability in Scelight).<br>
				Archon mode support includes:
				<ul><li>Archon mode is indicated in the format property with value "Archon", and as such it is visible on the Game info tab in the Replay Analyzer, in the "Format" Replay list column and in the "[format]" name template symbol.</li>
				<li>Build orders tab in the Replay Analyzer shows builds for the teams (not for individual users).</li>
				<li>Map info tab in the Replay Analyzer displays full teams as "player names".</li>
				<li>Player Stats chart and all sub-charts calculate and display data for the whole team only, these statistics have no meaning and cannot be broken down into individual users (as teams control one common base / player). These include SQ and Supply Capped %. Basically this is the same as turning on the "Teams As One" combo box for non-Archon replays. Other charts and metrics are still calculated individually for each user/player, but can be "merged" into one by enabling the "Teams As One" combo box (this also works for non-Archon replays).</li>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">This release comes with the option to run Scelight on Windows without Java having to be installed!</span><br> On Windows
					Operating Systems if you can't or don't want to install Java on your system, you can download a prepared JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from the Scelight <a

				<li><span class="h">Merged Accounts in Multi-Replay Analyzer</span><br>If you have multiple accounts and / or you play on multiple regions, you

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Time trend tab in Multi-Replay Analyzer</span><br> The Time trend tab encapsulates the previous Hour and Day tabs, and adds
					further Session, Date (day of month) and Month (month of year) tabs.<br> The <span class="h">Playing Session</span> (or simply <span class="h">Session</span>)
					is a series of <span class="h">subsequent</span> plays where the break between plays is not greater than a specified limit. This limit is the Max Session
					Break and can be viewed / changed on the Multi-Replay Analyzer settings page.<br> The Time trend Session tab analyzes your Playing Sessions, and
					calculates statistics for the plays based on their <span class="h">position</span> in their Playing Sessions.<br> The value in the "Play # in session"
					column tells which play from each session is included in the row's statistics. For example the first row (Play # in session = 1) shows you statistics of
					your first plays from each session (this is when you sit down and start to play).<br> You can use this Time trend Session statistics to analyze your <span
					class="h">stamina</span> and decide how many practice plays you need before you go serious, or after how many plays you should take a break before your
					performance starts to deteriorate.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Timelapse tab in Multi-Replay Analyzer</span><br> The Timelapse tab has multiple sub-tabs: Session, Year, Month, Week, Day,
					Play. Each shows general stats aggregated for the specified time periods / granularity.<br> The Timelapse Session tab lists all your playing sessions,
					and a session stats row shows statistics for all the plays of that particular session (contrary to the Time trend Session tab which takes one play from
					each session at the most based on the play's position).<br> The final Play tab lists every single play of the player.<br> This can be used to
					view your time development, improvement over time.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Numeric columns</span> in Stats tables of the Multi-Replay Analyzer are now displayed as <span class="h">progress bars</span>
					making the rows visually comparable.<br> This basically turns all numeric columns into <span class="h">vertical bar charts</span>; or more than that
					because the table (and thus the bar chart) can be filtered and sorted by any columns.</li>

				<li>Added new columns to Map stats tabs in the Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> New columns include the <span class="h">Map size</span> column, which is
					sorted by the map area (width*height). Sorting by this you can check for example how game length relates to the map size.
				</li>

				<li>The "Races %" column in the Multi-Replay Analyzer is now rendered as a <span class="h">colored bar code</span>.<br> Each race has its color
					(based on SC2 itself: <font color="blue">Blue</font> for Protoss, <font color="green">Green</font> for Terran and <font color="red">Red</font> for Zerg),
					and the race distribution is visualized with a multi-colored bar making the used races visually standing out.
				</li>

				<li>The APM, SPM, SQ, SC % tabs have been grouped into a <span class="h">"Metric trend"</span> tab.
				</li>

				<li>Added a new "Multi-Replay Analyze Replays of the Selected Row" to the tool bar of all stats table. With this you can launch a new Multi-Replay
					Analyzer to analyze only the replays of the selected stats row.</li>

				<li>Scelight External Module API and SDK 1.2.</li>

					stats and calculations have been added (Calendar view, APM-SPM-SQ-SC% range stats; Expansion, Result, sum Race and League stats).<br> Detects and
					displays <span class="h">player name changes</span> (including both clan and character name changes).<br> The new <span class="h">Calendar view</span>
					shows stats grouped by day in a calendar layout, also uses different colors to indicate the total play time on each day (in Player details).<br> In
					any stats table you can select a row and <span class="h">list the replays that assemble the stats of the selected row</span> (this was a long awaited,
					missing feature in Sc2gears). The result Replay list can also be filtered further with the Scelight Replay filter system, and further filtered results can
					also be opened in a new Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> In the Multi-Replay Analyzer you also have the option to view / edit the filters that were used to
					perform the analysis, and you can fine-tune the filters to repeat the analysis in a new Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> The Replay Folders page now
					contains new 2 buttons to launch a Multi-Replay Analyzer for the selected Replay folder, with the attached or custom filters.<br> The Replay list page
					also contains a new button to Multi-Replay Analyze all listed replays (using the same source and filters), and a new button to Multi-Replay Analyze only
					the selected replays.</li>
				<li>The general table tool bar (with search and filter) now also shows the <span class="h">Selected</span> rows count along with the Listed and All

				<li>The Replay list column setup dialog now also shows an <span class="h">icon</span> column.
				</li>
				<li>Added many new icons.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">External Module API 1.0</span><br> The External Module API has reached version 1.0 and is now public. This means everyone can
					now create external modules for Scelight to extend its functionalities and capabilities.<br> The External Module API exposes advanced engines,
					components and libraries, the very <span class="h">core</span> APIs that are used <span class="h">internally</span> to build the UI and features of
					Scelight, making it possible for external modules to create UIs that are <span class="h">consistent</span> with Scelight and to <span class="h">deeply
						integrate</span> into Scelight. The Scelight External Module API is more than just an interface API: it is a <span class="h">platform</span>.<br> This means
					the power is in your hands, but to utilize this power you have get familiar with certain aspects, concepts and interfaces of the API (the 1.0 API exposes <span
					class="h">hundreds</span> of interfaces and classes).<br> Main exposed components:
					<ul>
						<li>Application logger.</li>
						<li>Language and locale specific utilities.</li>
						<li>Extended and custom Swing GUI component library.</li>
						<li>Settings. External modules can specify settings and integrate into the Settings dialog; take advantage of setting dependent and bound components
							and listen to setting changes.</li>
						<li>Replay parser engine.</li>
						<li>Replay processor engine.</li>
						<li>Basic SC2 Balance Data.</li>
						<li>Name template engine.</li>
						<li>Replay search engine.</li>
						<li>SC2 monitor (current game status, live APM, game status change listening).</li>
						<li>Replay folder monitor (new replay listening).</li>
						<li>Sound utilities (background sound player - including MP3 format).</li>
						<li>General utilities to help implement any kind of code.</li>
					</ul> More will be added / exposed in the future.<br> The External Module API library also contains the source code of the interface. This means whenever
					you use the auto-complete feature of modern IDEs (like Eclipse) or you move your mouse cursor over different parts of your code, the Javadoc of the
					appropriate entity (e.g. a method or interface) will be displayed to you.<br> The External Module API is part of the Scelight External Module SDK (see
					below), you can download it from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads">Downloads</a> page.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Scelight External Module SDK</span><br> I have created an SDK (Software Development Kit) to aid the development of Scelight
					External Modules. You can download the Scelight External Module SDK from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads">Downloads</a> page.<br>
					The SDK is a <span class="h">complete Eclipse project</span> with an Ant build script which can build releases of the external module, make deployments,
					install / inject it into a Scelight installation and make project backups.<br> The SDK also contains the External Module API library and its Javadoc.<br>
					To get started with the SDK, first download it and extract it, then use the File / Import... menu in Eclipse, choose "Existing Projects into Workspace" and
					select the extracted ScelightExtModSDK folder which is the Eclipse project root.<br> The External Module SDK also contains an example Hello World
					external module with source code.<br> External Module API, SDK and general external module development info: <a
					href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/external-modules">External Modules</a><br> The Javadoc from the External Module API archive is also a
					number one source of information, and it is also available online for browsing here: <a href="https://scelightop.appspot.com/scelight-ext-mod-api/">Scelight
						External Module API Javadoc</a></li>

				<li>The Components page of the About dialog now lists loaded and started external modules too, and a new "Type" column displays the type of the
					components.</li>

				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>A new chart under the Player stats chart: <span class="h">Food Made+Used</span><br> This chart shows Food Made and Food Used charts at once,
					making it easy to see supply capped periods (when Food Used is greater than or equal to Food Made).
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Users tab improvements</span><br> A new column has been added: <span class="h">Supply-capped %</span>. This shows the ratio of
					supply-capped time and the time of the last command of the user (this is much more informative than the supply-capped time which depends on the game
					length).<br> Columns have been reordered based on importance and <span class="h">comparable metrics are now displayed as progress bars</span>, making
					the users visually comparable.<br> These include the following columns: APM, SPM, SQ, Supply-capped %, Swarm Levels.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Search engine improvements</span><br> Slightly rearranged filter properties based on importance and added new properties to
					filter by:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="h">"Is Beta / PTR?"</span>: Using this new filter you can list only Beta / PTR replays, or exclude them.</li>
						<li><span class="h">"[Players Avg] Avg. Supply-capped %"</span>: Using this you can filter replays based on the average supply-capped percent of
							players.</li>
						<li><span class="h">"Supply-capped %"</span>: This is a player filter to be applied on a player (any, all or a specific player).</li>
					</ul> The <span class="h">"Is Competitive?"</span> filter now also accepts AutoMM games with version less than 2.0 (when there was no unranked games and AutoMM
					games were equal to ladder games).</li>
				<li><span class="h">Last Game info Overlay card improvements</span><br> Rearranged columns based on importance and to be consistent with the Users
					tab, also added a new column: <span class="h">SP%</span> (Supply-capped percent).</li>
				<li>Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when contents of sub-tabs of the Inspector tab (visible only on Developer skill level) of the Replay
					analyzer were scrolled with the mouse scroll wheel.</li>
				<li>The External Module API design and development got a boost and jumped to version 0.6, getting closer to public release.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

		</div>
		<div class="pbody">
			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Filters and Replay Search</span><br> Powerful filters and advanced Replay Search have finally arrived. Predefined replay
					filters can be <span class="h">attached</span> to Replay folders, and when you want to list the contents of a Replay folder, the attached filters will be
					applied <span class="h">automatically</span>.<br> You can view/edit the attached Replay filters of a Replay folder by selecting the Replay folder and
					pressing the new "Edit Attached Filters" button. This will open the Replay Filters Editor (see below).<br> You can also <span class="h">search
						Replay folders</span> by pressing the "Search Replay Folders" button in which case a Replay Filters Editor will pop up where you can specify custom filters
					(instead of the attached filters).<br> A new "Filters" column indicates the <i>active</i> attached filters count for each Replay folder in the table.
					<i>Active</i> means it is enabled and it is valid (contains no errors).<br> The Replay list page now has a new <span class="h">"View / Edit
						Filters and Repeat Search"</span> button. This opens a Replay Filters Editor where you can view the filters that were applied when replays were listed, and you
					can also modify these filters (<i>tune</i> them) and repeat the search on the source Replay folder. Repeating the search will list the new results in a new
					Replay list page.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Replay Filters Editor</span><br> The Replay Filters Editor is used to view and edit Replay filters that are applied when
					searching / listing replays of a Replay folder.<br> <span class="h">It is table-based, equation-editor-like, easy but powerful filters editor.</span>
					It is easy to quickly add a few filters like Map name, Replay date, Version, Region etc.<br> It is also possible to build complex queries as it
					supports <span class="h">filter connections</span> like logical AND and logical OR, supports <span class="h">parenthesis (grouping of filters)</span>, and
					<span class="h">advanced operators</span> like contains, starts with, ends with and <span class="h">MATCHES</span> (regular expression matching).<br>
					The search engine supports too many properties to enumerate them all. To easily find and pick the ones you're interested in, filter properties (called
					Filter by) are organized into groups (called Filter by Group).<br> There are also special groups to filter by player properties. Special groups are at
					your disposal to filter by <span class="h">aggregate values</span> of all players of a replay (e.g. weighted average APM of all players of a replay); to
					filter by a property of <span class="h">any player</span>, of <span class="h">all players</span>, or to specify filters on <span class="h">different
						players</span> or <span class="h">multiple filters on the same player</span>.<br> There is also a <span class="h">Filters Structure Preview</span> which
					shows the structure of the filters in a <span class="h">tree-like formatted table</span>.<br> Queries like this are easily possible (you can see
					exactly this query on the image):<br> <i>"replays from the US or Europe region with HotS expansion that are longer than 10 min and were not played
						on any of the Daybreak maps and have a player named Dakota who is above Gold league and have another player with more than 50 APM with a clan tag in its
						name and have a player with Protoss race that could be anyone and average SPM of all players is at least 5 and all players have reached level 90"</i><br>
					Specifying and editing filters is done via an editable table. Just click on any cell to view your options and to edit it.<br> The constructed filters
					can also be <span class="h">saved</span> to a file or previously saved filters can be <span class="h">loaded</span> from a file.</li>
				<li><span class="h">A new Replay list column: "Played"</span><br> This column will show you the replay date in the form of played "xxx" ago (<span
					class="h">relative</span> to the current time).<br> Examples: "12m 30s" means 12 minutes and 30 sec ago, "7h 15m" means 7 hours and 15 min ago, "2w
					1d" means 2 weeks and 1 day ago, "2y 2M" means 2 years and 2 months ago.</li>
				<li>Relative date is also displayed at many other locations.</li>
				<li>Replay list progress bar now displays Added, Filtered out and Errors (renamed from Skipped).</li>
				<li><span class="h">Unfocusable Overlay cards.</span><br> Overlay cards are now not focusable by default. This means they do not hijack focus when
					they are displayed, nor do they hijack focus when you click on them. Focus remains in SC2 (or in your active application).<br> Of course you can still
					activate / open the Overlay config menu by clicking on it, but this also will not hijack the focus from SC2 (or your active application).<br> This
					focusable state can be toggled in the config menu of the Overlay card.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Moving Overlay cards outside the main screen.</span><br> By default Overlay cards cannot be moved outside the main screen, and
					this has not changed. But now the Overlay config menu contains a new option: "Allow outside the main screen". If you enable this, Scelight will not align
					the Overlay cards anymore, you will be able to position them outside the main screen, onto your additional screens if you have a multi-screen
					configuration.</li>
				<li>Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when the Events table or the Replay list table were scrolled with the mouse scroll wheel.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Base Control chart</span><br>The Base Control chart is the successor to the Main Building Control of Sc2gears.<br> It
					visualizes Spawn Larva, Chrono Boost, Calldown MULE, Scanner Sweep and Calldown Extra Supply commands, and calculates some metrics like the Average
					Spawning Ratio and Average Injection Gap, also broken down to Hatcheries.<br> Moving the mouse cursor over any box will show details about the related
					command and clicking on it will jump to the corresponding command properly - as with any other chart object on any other charts.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Improved Template Engine</span><br> New player-specific symbols which can be parameterized by a player index which must be
					outside of a Player Info Block and which insert the value only for the specified player.<br> E.g. the symbol <span class="h">player1</span> will
					insert the name of the first player, <span class="h">apm1</span> will insert the APM of the first player etc. Useful for example if you add yourself to the
					Favored player list, and in 1v1 games you will always be the first player and your opponent the second player.<br> The <span class="h">mapWordsX</span>,
					<span class="h">counterX</span> and <span class="h">repCounterX</span> symbols are now also parameterized and listed only once.<br> Of course these
					can also be combined with the value range, so for example [leagueLong2{1-3}] will return the first 3 letters of the 2nd player's league (your opponent if
					you're on the favored list).</li>
				<li><span class="h">New Replay list table columns: APM1, APM2, SPM1, SPM2, SQ1, SQ2, L1, L2 to return the corresponding value for the 1st and
						2nd player only.</span><br> The Replay list table can be sorted by these columns properly.</li>

		<div class="pbody">
			<b>At last! The first public version of Scelight&trade; is released!</b><br> I still have a long way ahead, but the current version is already useful
			enough to be shared. It is also better for everyone to give / get feedback earlier.<br> <br> <b>Some highlights of Scelight:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Supports replays of <span class="h">all versions</span> starting from 1.0; including all beta and PTR versions.
				</li>
				<li>Supports replays of <span class="h">all types</span>; including single player and all custom game replays.
				</li>
				<li>A more advanced <span class="h">name template engine</span> and <span class="h">template editor</span> to rename new replays in their <i>original
						folder</i>, to <i>auto-backup</i> them or <i>manually rename multiple replays</i> at once. It comes with a <span class="h">rich set of symbols</span> to use
					in name templates.
				</li>
				<li>A more advanced <span class="h">Replay listing</span> module with a <span class="h"> rich set of columns</span> to customize the replay list
					tables. You can even create <span class="h">new custom columns</span> specified with flexible name templates.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">A new charts system</span> which is similar to Sc2gears' but is <span class="h">way more powerful</span>: more presentation types,
					granularity in seconds instead of pixels (graphs remain immune to zoom and resize), zoom into arbitrary small time window, 3-state enlarging for wheel
					scroll click etc.</li>
				<li>Charts showing <span class="h">precise supply, workers, resources</span>, broken down to Army, Economy, Technology, categorized by Current, Lost,
					Killed, In Progress.
				</li>
				<li>A new <span class="h">SPM (Screens / min)</span> metric and chart to visualize and measure the <span class="h">multitasking skills</span> of
					players.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="h">Spending Quotient (SQ)</span> has arrived to measure the <span class="h">macro skills</span> of players, and not just as a
					calculated average metric, it has its own chart showing the spending skill throughout the entire game, optionally broken down to resource types.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Build Orders table</span> showing exact build / upgrade activity of all players at once for the whole game.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Scelight Launcher</span> which installs and automatically keeps your Scelight always up-to-date without intervention.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Module system:</span> Official external modules are listed inside Scelight, and they can be installed with one click, and have kept
					auto-updated.</li>
				<li>There is an option to choose your <span class="h">computer skill level</span>. Based on this Scelight can hide or simplify some things which you
					might not need or might not understand, resulting in <span class="h">clearer</span> user interface and <span class="h">better</span> user experience.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Hierarchical</span> settings presentation with <span class="h">filters</span>.</li>
				<li>Nice formatted <span class="h">context sensitive helps and tips</span> which aid to easily understand features and settings you don't know.
				</li>
				<li>A fast, secure, central <span class="h">Scelight Operator</span> server to serve Scelight clients based on Google's specialized, cloud based
					content serving.
				</li>
				<li>Advanced tools for <span class="h">inspecting replay internals</span> for developers.

			<span class="note">2013</span> March 22 - The Beginning
		</div>
		<div class="pbody">
			Development of Scelight&trade; begins.<br> <br> But wait...<br> <b>What has led to a successor instead of just updating Sc2gears&trade;?</b><br>
			<br> Many things. To mention the main reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>Sc2gears has become <span class="h">big</span>. Too big. I never thought I will add so many features to it in the beginning and so it was becoming
					harder and harder to maintain.
				</li>
				<li>Many claimed Sc2gears was <span class="h">difficult to use</span>. It has so many features, many didn't understand a lot of them.
				</li>
				<li>I have also received <span class="h">complaints</span> about the <span class="h">UI design</span> of Sc2gears.
				</li>
				<li>Blizzard finally decided to provide <span class="h">official support</span> for parsing replays: they released a low-level open source python
					library called 's2protocol'.
				</li>
				<li>During the last 3-year development and maintenance of Sc2gears, I <span class="h">improved</span> a lot and <span class="h">gained an
						enormous experience</span>, I got to know the SC2 replay format more and more, and Blizzard included more and more information in replays.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Java 7 became standard</span>, and it has new features which can be put to use.</li>
			</ul>
			Due to the aforementioned improvements, if I were to rewrite Sc2gears, I would do many things quite differently. It is much easier to do these different
			things in a fresh new project than to refactor an existing huge and complex project. Without refactoring on the long-run I would just make my job even worse.<br>
			No question it would've been easier to just update Sc2gears than to create something entirely new. But I plan a much longer and more important role for my
			project than to just choose the easier path.<br> <br>
